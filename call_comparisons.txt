--- MISSING ELEMENTS IN BAD CALL ---
1.  **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Usage / Call Preparation:** The agent in the bad call clearly did not access or review any prior customer interaction notes or CRM entries before or during the call, leading to significant confusion regarding names and past meetings.
2.  **Proactive Problem Identification and Resolution:** Instead of getting stuck in a loop of identity clarification, the agent should have quickly identified the core problem (misidentification) and offered a swift resolution, such as transferring to a colleague or checking internal records more thoroughly.
3.  **Active Listening and Confirmation:** The agent consistently failed to listen effectively and confirm details, instead repeatedly correcting the customer's perception of names and past conversations, escalating frustration.
4.  **Empathy and Professional Tone:** The agent lacked empathy, appearing defensive and prioritizing correcting the customer's memory over understanding their actual query and maintaining a helpful, professional demeanor.
5.  **Clear Next Steps and Accountability:** The bad call ended without a concrete plan or a clear timeline for how the customer's initial query would eventually be addressed, lacking accountability for follow-up.

--- WINNING PHRASES MAPPING ---
1.  "what the best we can do, we can just schedule a Google Meet so that we can have a proper discussion about everything like your queries I will be like answering and we can have your planning as well." (2:39-2:48)
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** After the initial confusion about names (e.g., around 1:20 or 2:00), once some basic information is confirmed. The agent could say, "I apologize for the confusion regarding the names. To ensure we properly address your needs, what I can do is schedule a Google Meet with the correct team member so we can have a proper discussion about everything, and I will make sure all your queries are answered and we can plan effectively."
    *   **Expected Impact:** This phrase would immediately shift the focus from past confusion and blame to a clear, actionable, and future-oriented solution. It demonstrates proactivity, offers a structured discussion, and implies expert handling, thereby rebuilding trust and injecting momentum into the stalled conversation.

2.  "you are products should be available on those particular pincodes. Okay? And as a company we are not providing any services on Blinkit and. Because we can't provide any actual services there." (1:17-1:26)
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** While this specific context (selling on platforms) wasn't reached, if the conversation had progressed to specific service limitations. For example, if the customer requested a service the company doesn't offer.
    *   **Expected Impact:** This phrase provides a clear, logical, and transparent reason for why a particular service or platform cannot be supported, without being dismissive. It sets realistic expectations and prevents further misunderstanding by offering a justifiable explanation, which is crucial for maintaining trust even when delivering a "no."

3.  "But we're working on marketplaces because they help you to like build a brand and provide you end to end everything." (1:35-1:41)
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** Similar to the previous phrase, if a service limitation was identified, this phrase would follow the explanation of "why not." For instance, "While we might not directly support X, we focus on marketplaces like Y and Z because they help you to build a brand and provide you end-to-end everything."
    *   **Expected Impact:** This phrase immediately pivots from a "no" to a positive "yes, and here's how we can help even better," framing alternatives as superior solutions. It focuses on tangible customer benefits (brand building, comprehensive support), demonstrating the agent's problem-solving attitude and re-engaging the customer positively, even if their initial request isn't directly met.

--- MISSING ELEMENTS IN BAD CALL ---
1.  **Initial Verification and Confirmation:** The agent in the bad call immediately states query details without first asking the customer to confirm their identity or if they recall making any recent inquiries.
2.  **Apology for Potential System Error/Confusion:** Upon the customer's repeated denial, the agent does not apologize for the confusion or the possibility of a system error.
3.  **Offer to Investigate Data Discrepancy:** The agent never offers to investigate why their system shows a query from the customer if the customer explicitly denies it.
4.  **Empathy and Acknowledgment of Customer's Perspective:** There is no attempt to acknowledge the customer's confusion or frustration when they deny having raised the query.
5.  **Proactive Problem-Solving/Alternative Assistance:** The call ends without any proposed solution to rectify the incorrect query or to offer assistance if the customer *did* have a different query.

--- WINNING PHRASES MAPPING ---
1.  "अच्छा, नहीं मुझे लगा आप वो आपने नंबर नहीं दिया, टू टिक नहीं आई तो मैंने सोचा शायद..." (0:06-0:10)
    -> **Where to use in Bad Call:** When the customer first denies making the query (e.g., after 0:17).
    -> **Expected Impact:** This phrase would allow the agent to acknowledge the customer's denial while explaining their own system's perspective. It signals active listening and a willingness to understand the discrepancy, rather than just insisting, making the customer feel heard and potentially preventing frustration.

2.  "हम आइडियली कॉलिंग से कनेक्ट नहीं करते हैं, मैं आपको... मैं आपको मैसेज भेजा था..." (0:26-0:31)
    -> **Where to use in Bad Call:** After the customer denies the query multiple times (e.g., after 0:26).
    -> **Expected Impact:** The agent could pivot from the incorrect query to a preferred or standard communication method. This shifts the focus from the disputed query to how they usually interact with customers, creating an opening for general assistance or to re-verify contact methods, rather than just repeating query details.

3.  "ऐसा हुआ तो हम Google Meet के थ्रू कनेक्ट हो जाएंगे जिससे कि वो भी कनेक्ट हो सकें Google Meet के लिंक पर और हम भी कनेक्ट हो सकें सो दैट कि हम फेस टू फेस बैठ के बात भी कर पाएं।" (2:02-2:10)
    -> **Where to use in Bad Call:** At the end of the call, when the customer is clearly confused and denying the query (e.g., after 0:56).
    -> **Expected Impact:** Instead of ending on a note of confusion, this phrase offers a clear, proactive, and collaborative solution. It could turn a negative interaction into a problem-solving opportunity, even if the initial query was invalid, by showing a commitment to help or clarify further, building potential trust.

--- MISSING ELEMENTS IN BAD CALL ---
1.  **Acknowledging Current State:** The agent fails to acknowledge and validate the customer's statement that they are currently managing their Amazon account themselves.
2.  **Probing for Future Needs/Pain Points:** Instead of pushing the service directly, the agent misses the opportunity to probe for potential future challenges or growth areas where their service could eventually be beneficial.
3.  **Open-Ended Discovery Questions:** The agent primarily asks yes/no or confirmation questions, rather than open-ended questions that could uncover underlying needs or motivations.
4.  **Active Listening to Disinterest:** The agent does not actively listen to or respond to the customer's explicit statements of disinterest (e.g., "abhi requirement to nahi hai manager ki").
5.  **Establishing Value Proposition Early:** The agent attempts to sell the service without first establishing a clear value proposition tailored to the customer's current situation or potential future needs.

--- WINNING PHRASES MAPPING ---
1.  "तो आप मुझे जो WhatsApp पर कांटेक्ट करती हैं, ये वो कौन सा नंबर है?" (0:17)
    -> **Where to use in Bad Call:** After the customer clarifies they are managing their Amazon account themselves (around 0:39-0:41 or 0:52-0:53).
    -> **Expected Impact:** This demonstrates active listening and a genuine attempt to understand the customer's current setup. It shifts from a sales pitch to a more consultative approach, potentially uncovering specific aspects of their current management that could be improved or areas where they might need help.

2.  "और फिर एक कॉन्फ्रेंस कॉल कर लेंगे।" (1:58)
    -> **Where to use in Bad Call:** After the customer states they are managing things themselves and mentions their daily order volume (around 1:09).
    -> **Expected Impact:** This shows proactive problem-solving. Instead of pushing for a manager, the agent could suggest a quick, low-commitment conference call to simply *share insights* on how others manage similar order volumes or discuss general best practices, thereby building trust without directly selling.

3.  "ऐसा हुआ तो हम Google Meet के थ्रू कनेक्ट हो जाएंगे, जिससे कि वो भी गाइड तो सकें Google Meet के लिंक पर और हम भी कनेक्ट हो सकें सो दैट कि हम face-to-face बैठकर बात भी कर पाएं।" (2:02)
    -> **Where to use in Bad Call:** When suggesting the conference call (as per the previous point) or if the customer expresses any hesitation about a direct call.
    -> **Expected Impact:** This phrase offers flexibility and a more personal, collaborative approach. It frames the interaction as a shared learning or problem-solving session rather than a hard sell, potentially making the customer more amenable to engaging and sharing more information. The "face-to-face" aspect (even virtual) helps build rapport and trust.

--- MISSING ELEMENTS IN BAD CALL ---
1.  **Preparation/Contextual Knowledge:** The agent in the bad call clearly lacked any prior knowledge or a quick review of the customer's previous interactions (e.g., onboarding with "Anshul/Adarsh").
2.  **Effective Identity Verification:** The agent failed to correctly identify the customer or their company's previous engagement, leading to a prolonged and unproductive discussion about names.
3.  **Customer Need Elicitation:** The call never progressed to understanding *why* the customer was calling beyond the initial confusion, completely missing the opportunity to discover their actual business needs.
4.  **Solution Provision:** Since the customer's problem was never properly identified, no relevant solutions or value could be offered during the call.
5.  **Clear Next Steps & Ownership:** The call ended vaguely with the agent stating he would connect the customer to someone else, without a concrete plan or taking ownership of the follow-up.

--- WINNING PHRASES MAPPING ---
1.  "what the best we can do is just schedule a Google Meet so that we can have a proper discussion about everything like your queries I will be like answering and we can have your planning as well."
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** At the point where the agent is confused about the previous meeting or client identity.
    *   **Expected Impact:** This would immediately pivot the conversation from confusion to a structured, solution-oriented approach, demonstrating professionalism and a clear path forward, even if initial context is missing. It implies taking ownership and a willingness to resolve the issue systematically.

2.  "Because we can't provide any actual services not there. Because the client has not acknowledged for like actual inventory. So therefore it is not possible to help on BlinqIt and Vep. But we are working on marketplaces because they help you to like build a brand and provide you end to end everything."
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** If the customer had mentioned a specific platform they wanted to use (like BlinqIt in the good call) and the agent needed to explain why it might not be suitable *from their side*.
    *   **Expected Impact:** This demonstrates transparency and expertise. It explains *why* something isn't possible, rather than just saying "no," and then immediately pivots to a viable alternative, showing a solution-oriented mindset.

3.  "Yeah, Amazon, Flipkart, JioMart, or Myntra, any market place, we can provide you."
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** After identifying the customer's core business need (e.g., selling products online).
    *   **Expected Impact:** This immediately shows the breadth of the agent's company's capabilities and reassures the customer that they can assist with their primary objective, building confidence and moving the conversation towards concrete solutions.

--- MISSING ELEMENTS IN BAD CALL ---
1.  **In-depth probing on the "minus" account:** The agent in the bad call failed to ask crucial questions about *why* the customer's account went into a negative balance, what products were involved, or previous strategies implemented. This lack of discovery prevents them from truly understanding the core problem.
2.  **Specific examples/case studies:** While stating they are a "leading company" (4:50-4:54), the agent offered no concrete examples of how they've helped similar businesses (e.g., imitation jewelry) recover from negative account balances or achieve significant sales growth.
3.  **A strong value proposition tailored to the "minus" account:** The agent listed generic services (listing, optimization, keywords) but did not explicitly articulate how these services would directly address and rectify the customer's "minus" account issue, or how they guarantee profitable sales for his specific product.
4.  **Confident problem ownership:** Instead of confidently stating a plan to analyze and fix the "minus" account, the agent asked for login details to "see" the account (5:41), which conveys uncertainty and shifts the burden of investigation onto the customer's information.
5.  **Clear next steps with a commitment:** The call ended vaguely with the customer saying "I will call you later" (6:19-6:20). A strong closing would have involved scheduling a definite follow-up, offering to send a tailored action plan, or a more direct request for commitment.

--- WINNING PHRASES MAPPING ---
1.  "आप निश्चित हो के काम कर सकते हो सर, बिल्कुल।" (You can absolutely do this work with confidence, sir, absolutely.)
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** At 6:18, when the customer says "मैं आपको फोन करता हूं बाद में" (I will call you later), indicating hesitation.
    *   **Expected Impact:** This phrase would inject much-needed confidence and reassurance into the conversation. It directly addresses any lingering doubts and encourages the customer to trust the agent's capability, potentially moving them past their indecision.

2.  "हम पूरी प्रोफाइल पर हम ही लोग टेक केयर करेंगे।" (We will take care of the entire profile ourselves.)
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** At 1:24, when the agent is explaining their services, or at 4:58 when discussing visibility and account management.
    *   **Expected Impact:** This phrase clearly conveys comprehensive ownership and expertise, assuring the customer that all aspects of their online presence will be handled professionally. In the bad call, the agent's lack of ownership over the "minus" account was a significant weakness, which this phrase could mitigate.

3.  "हम लोग कोशिश करते हैं कि टॉप थ्री, टॉप फोर में आपकी प्रोफाइल आए, जो कि जाती भी है।" (We try to get your profile in the top three, top four, and it does happen.)
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** At 5:10-5:12, when the agent mentions increasing visibility without strong conviction.
    *   **Expected Impact:** This phrase sets a clear, ambitious, yet achievable goal, backed by a strong assertion of actual success. It would transform a vague promise of "visibility increase" into a tangible, high-ranking outcome, building confidence in the agent's ability to deliver measurable results.

--- MISSING ELEMENTS IN BAD CALL ---
1.  **Proactive Business Needs Discovery:** The agent in the bad call does not proactively ask about the customer's overall business goals, target audience, competitive landscape, or specific challenges beyond the initial request to sell clothes online. This limits the ability to tailor solutions.
2.  **Customized Solution Framing:** The agent provides generic descriptions of services (account creation, listings, etc.) without explicitly connecting them to the customer's specific boutique business, product range, or brand identity.
3.  **Holistic Digital Marketing Guidance:** When the customer inquires about Google listing, the agent dismisses it as outside their scope rather than explaining *why* they focus on marketplaces (e.g., conversion rates, specific target audience for e-commerce) or offering alternative, albeit separate, guidance.
4.  **Rapport Building and Emotional Connection:** The agent's tone is very transactional and lacks warmth or genuine interest, which prevents building a strong rapport and makes the conversation feel impersonal.
5.  **Proactive Pricing Value Justification:** The agent directly states prices without first building sufficient value or context for the cost, making it feel like a commodity rather than a solution for the customer's business.

--- WINNING PHRASES MAPPING ---
1.  **"तो सागर की इसमें हम ऐसा करते हैं ना कि इतना मैं आपको इसमें बेस्ट से बेस्ट डिस्काउंट भी प्रोवाइड करा दूंगी आप प्रोसीड कीजिए जिस दिन से आप बोलेंगे उस दिन से फिर मैं आपका वर्क स्टार्ट करा दूंगी बिलिंग साइकिल मैं उसी दिन से स्टार्ट कर दूंगी सर आपकी।"** (File 1, 2:00-2:11)
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** When discussing pricing or when the customer asks for plan details (File 2, 0:59-1:00, 1:49-1:51, 1:33:00-1:34:00).
    *   **Expected Impact:** This proactively addresses potential pricing concerns by offering a discount and shows flexibility in billing, which can make the offer more attractive and encourage immediate commitment. In the bad call, prices are stated rigidly. This phrase introduces flexibility and a value-add, shifting focus from a fixed cost to a tailored solution.

2.  **"मैम, आपका जो ऑनबोर्डिंग प्रोसीजर वगैरह है, वो सब चीजें कर लेते हैं। जैसे ही आप बताएंगे कि आप रेडी हैं, हम तभी उस पर वर्क स्टार्ट कर देंगे सर।"** (File 1, 1:34-1:41)
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** When the customer states they need time to discuss with their husband and requests details (File 2, 1:108-1:110, 1:123-1:126).
    *   **Expected Impact:** This demonstrates flexibility and proactive problem-solving. Instead of just sending details and waiting, it keeps the momentum by completing initial steps that don't require the husband's immediate input. This makes the customer feel supported and reduces the perceived delay, potentially leading to faster conversion.

3.  **"आपका अकाउंट क्रिएशन से लेकर सपोर्ट करने तक सब कुछ रहता है सर हमारा।"** (File 1, 1:51-1:56)
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** When the customer asks about what the digital marketing service includes, or when she's asking about listing options (File 2, 1:11:00-1:15:00, 1:50-1:58).
    *   **Expected Impact:** This emphasizes the comprehensive, end-to-end nature of the service, addressing potential unspoken concerns about fragmented support. It builds confidence by assuring the customer that they will be fully supported throughout their journey, not just at specific steps. In the bad call, the agent's explanation of services is more fragmented, so this phrase would provide a clearer, more reassuring picture of continuous support.

[01:19] Agent: Like creating your seller account, category approvals, brand approvals, listing, listing optimization, keyword management, brand promotion, return, claims, these services are provided.
[01:32] Agent: From your end, we only need two inputs: product images you provide us, and basic information from your end.
[01:39] Agent: So you will give us these two inputs, and the rest, we will do end-to-end.
[01:43] Agent: As you mentioned.
[01:45] Customer: What is the criteria, sir? Sorry to interrupt you, what is the criteria for this?
[01:49] Agent: Criteria for what, ma'am?
[01:52] Customer: If I want to do this process, what are the criteria and documents required, and what are the things you have to do?
[02:02] Agent: I will tell you. First, tell me which marketplaces you want to sell products on. Amazon, Flipkart?
[02:07] Customer: Till now I haven't sold on any marketplace, Amazon, Flipkart, on any. But now I want to start, sir.
[02:18] Agent: I will tell you, ma'am. If you want to start online selling, you should start with both Amazon and Flipkart marketplaces.
[02:24] Agent: From our end, first I'll tell you the required documentation for onboarding.
[02:31] Agent: We need your GST number, your registered trademark should be with us, PAN number, your email ID, some basic documents.
[02:38] Agent: If you have GST or trademark, both are with us.
[02:41] Agent: So, from our end, what all is included in end-to-end services?
[02:44] Agent: First, we do your account creation, then there are category approvals, brand approvals, then your listing, listing optimization, keyword management, your brand promotion, these are all the things.
[02:55] Agent: Now, where our expertise comes in, I'll tell you a bit about that.
[02:59] Agent: See, as you, Kamali, are saying you have a boutique, and you want to sell clothes as your products.
[03:03] Agent: Many people are selling clothes, so how are you different from them? How will your visibility come? That's where our expertise comes in.
[03:10] Agent: We have top-ranking marketing keywords and data, with the help of which we do all these things.
[03:15] Agent: So those things make us different from others.
[03:19] Agent: So suppose.
[03:20] Customer: Okay.
[03:21] Agent: You have shirts.
[03:22] Agent: We did a listing. Now, there are certain criteria, parameters for listing that we need to fulfill.
[03:27] Agent: Like your recommended vote note, leave note, targeted work frame, bullet pointers, RBNs, we have to fulfill all these major matrices.
[03:36] Agent: After that, your listing's visibility increases. For example, if someone searches for a shirt, or a kurta, kurta for men, or kurta for women, how will your visibility come?
[03:46] Agent: That's where our expertise comes in.
[03:47] Customer: Okay. Okay.
[03:48] Agent: Yes. These are all the things, along with that, your price management, brand promotions, returns, claims, these end-to-end services we provide.
[03:57] Agent: Yes.
[03:58] Customer: Okay, okay.
[03:59] Customer: Sir, how many listings can we select now? I mean, by listing, are you talking about Google listing or website listing?
[04:08] Agent: I am talking about Amazon listing, for listing your product on Amazon Flipkart.
[04:13] Customer: Okay, okay.
[04:14] Customer: Sir, how many are you suggesting for me to do this listing, how many?
[04:20] Agent: Ma'am, you should definitely go with Amazon, Flipkart. You know that Amazon and Flipkart are India's top leading e-commerce marketplaces.
[04:26] Agent: So they have the most traffic. If we start from there, we will get very good results here.
[04:32] Agent: Okay.
[04:32] Customer: Okay, okay. But sir, I also researched on one or two
[04:35] Customer: one or two other sites, sir, Amazon and Flipkart. These two are already there, but everyone is doing the same.
[04:44] Customer: Amazon and Flipkart, everyone is doing it from both. So if I try Meesho, because now more people are trying Meesho, why I should not invest into Meesho?
[04:56] Agent: Definitely, ma'am, you can do Meesho too.
[04:58] Agent: Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, all three marketplaces are suitable for you. What will be the ticket size of your products, like the average selling price of the product?
[05:07] Customer: Sorry?
[05:09] Agent: Your product's price?
[05:13] Customer: Sir, that product will depend on the individual product. If I talk about any kurta sets, the starting price will be 750 rupees. And if it is a single kurta top, the cost will be around 345 rupees. And if I talk about lehengas, it will depend on the cloth and the material of the cloth, the pricing.
[05:40] Agent: No problem, ma'am. Definitely, you can start with Meesho too, that will be entirely your choice.
[05:44] Agent: Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, all three marketplaces will be best for you.
[05:47] Agent: It's up to you whether you start with one marketplace initially or with all three.
[05:52] Agent: That will completely depend on you.
[05:55] Customer: Okay, okay.
[05:56] Customer: Sir, what is its plan pricing?
[06:01] Agent: I'll tell you a bit.
[06:02] Agent: Before pricing, let me tell you a couple of other things, let me briefly explain about our company.
[06:06] Agent: Basically, you have come through Gonukkad, so you must have seen, Pan India we are leading, we operate.
[06:12] Agent: Mr. Rajkumar Rao is our brand ambassador.
[06:15] Agent: Now you understand, if we have Mr. Rajkumar Rao as our brand ambassador, how big our vision would be, how long-term we are thinking.
[06:22] Agent: So I'm saying, no one is working with so many benefits as we are working.
[06:27] Agent: And our expertise, as I said, listing is a very basic thing. Optimizing it according to the algorithm and marketplace policies, that's where our expertise comes in.
[06:36] Agent: Okay.
[06:37] Customer: Okay, okay.
[06:38] Agent: As you said, if I talk about a single marketplace, like you are saying you want to go with Meesho, or only Amazon, for one marketplace our charges are 15,000 plus GST, for one quarter.
[06:47] Agent: This will be a three-month plan.
[06:49] Customer: 15,000 plus GST for one quarter, is this for Amazon or Flipkart?
[06:54] Agent: For a single marketplace. You can take Amazon, Flipkart, or even Meesho.
[06:58] Agent: For a single marketplace.
[06:59] Customer: Oh, this includes everything, this will be one plan price?
[07:03] Agent: No, not all together, only one.
[07:05] Agent: If we bring all three, Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, all three marketplaces, then our charges are basically 22,000 plus GST for one quarter.
[07:15] Customer: Okay, okay, okay. Got it. Got it.
[07:18] Customer: And also I have one more doubt, sir. Your head office is where?
[07:21] Agent: We are a Gurgaon-based company, basically we operate from Gurgaon.
[07:24] Customer: Gurgaon.
[07:25] Customer: Okay, where are you talking from right now, sir?
[07:28] Agent: We are talking from Gurgaon only, sir.
[07:31] Customer: Okay, do you have any branches in Bangalore?
[07:36] Agent: No, ma'am, we have many brands that are working in multiple cities like Bangalore, Delhi, Hyderabad, Pune, meaning we have brands in multiple cities.
[07:45] Agent: I'm talking about, along with our Gurgaon-based office, along with Gurgaon, we also operate in Hyderabad and Delhi-NCR.
[07:55] Agent: So, we have multiple things from our end.
[07:59] Customer: Sir, I also want Google listing option. I am asking that question because now when I search on Amazon, many people will search using signature words, keywords. But if someone doesn't know how to search, they will directly research on Google, right? So, something
[08:20] Agent: I'll tell you. What you are mentioning about Google, people make search engines on Google.
[08:24] Agent: So what happens on Google? If someone searches for a product on Google.
[08:28] Agent: Customers come to Amazon, Flipkart for specific things, to purchase products, to buy them.
[08:35] Agent: What you are saying, that I want to search on Google. On Google, someone will search for a sketch, or if you are a well-known brand, then our keyword stuffing will be at such a level that we perform better than Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho.
[08:48] Agent: So the choice is yours, you can choose any marketplace. If you say Meesho, we will do it for you on Meesho.
[08:53] Agent: That choice will be yours. But I will give you a better deal, don't worry about the pricing and all, I will provide a better one.
[08:59] Agent: But from your end, we will need two inputs: you will provide us with product images, and basic information will be from your end.
[09:06] Customer: Okay, okay. Got it. Got it.
[09:08] Customer: And also I have one more doubt, sir. Right now, if digital marketing is available, it will work. So what all will I get in digital marketing, sir? I mean, SEO and the PDF for digital marketing, please tell me about that.
[09:23] Agent: The things I am telling you here, I am telling you related to e-commerce.
[09:26] Agent: Basically, we are not digital marketing agencies, we are the onboarding partner of Amazon, our preferred partner of Flipkart.
[09:32] Agent: So you must have understood that digital marketing will be completely separate. We do all things on e-commerce marketplaces, so we are completely different organically.
[09:40] Customer: Hmm hmm.
[09:41] Customer: Okay, okay, okay.
[09:42] Customer: Sir, will this be an eight-month plan or only a monthly, individual month plan, or will it be a bulk plan, meaning three months once, and two months once?
[09:53] Agent: At least you will have to give us three months.
[09:57] Customer: Hmm hmm.
[09:58] Agent: It's tri-yearly or half-yearly. But our smallest package is quarterly. But don't worry about that, I will give you a better deal on pricing.
[10:06] Agent: Will you tell me, ma'am, when are we thinking of starting? Are you owning this business yourself?
[10:11] Customer: Sorry?
[10:12] Agent: Are you owning this business yourself?
[10:15] Customer: Sir, I am owning it, but my husband is supporting me for financial things and all.
[10:21] Agent: So, ma'am, I would say that at least you come with us for one quarter. You will get things at that level, then the next quarter will be very easy for you to start with us.
[10:31] Agent: Don't worry about the deal, I will give you a good deal in pricing or commercial because commercial terms don't matter much to us. What matters to us is quality service.
[10:39] Agent: If I can provide you quality service in the first quarter, then in the next quarter, I can demand that you come to our bigger packages, come to yearly plans, then it will be very easy for us and it will be very easy for you to proceed with us.
[10:51] Agent: So our vision is to stay connected with you long-term.
[10:55] Customer: Okay, okay. Got it.
[10:56] Customer: Sir, please do one thing for me, I need to discuss this with my husband.
[11:01] Customer: Okay, this is my WhatsApp number, please share your plan details with me on this.
[11:06] Customer: I will discuss with him within 24 hours and then I will call and inform him.
[11:12] Customer: Can you elaborate and explain the same thing to him?

[12:28] Customer: Sir, today will not be possible because he will be available at night after 8:00 o'clock. So it would be better if you call in the morning, sir.

--- MISSING ELEMENTS IN BAD CALL ---
1.  **Genuine Customer Empathy:** The Bad Call agent repeatedly asks "Minus?" or "Suspended?" without showing understanding of the customer's frustration or impact of the account being in "minus" for so long.
2.  **Clear Value Proposition for the Specific Problem:** The Bad Call agent lists generic services ("listing, optimization, keyword management") but fails to explicitly connect *how* these services will resolve the customer's primary concern of the "minus" balance or low visibility from being inactive.
3.  **Proactive Problem-Solving Approach:** The Bad Call agent is mostly reactive, responding to customer statements rather than proactively identifying underlying issues and offering tailored solutions for the "minus" account problem.
4.  **Strong Trust-Building Actions:** The Bad Call agent makes a highly problematic request for the customer's ID and password on the first call, which severely damages trust. This is a critical error.
5.  **Effective Objection Re-framing:** When the customer mentions his friend was managing the account, the agent does not effectively re-frame this as an opportunity for professional management or how their service differs from what a friend might do.

--- WINNING PHRASES MAPPING ---
1.  "हम लोग जो एसईओ कर रहे है वो लोकल एसईओ कर रहे है आपकी जीएमबी का। न कि आपकी वेबसाइट का।"
    *   Where to use in Bad Call: When the customer brings up his current account status or his previous efforts with his friend, or the "minus" balance.
    *   Expected Impact: This phrase would immediately differentiate the agent's service from what the customer might be trying to do or what his friend did, highlighting a specific area of expertise (GMB local SEO) that directly relates to increasing visibility and potentially resolving the "minus" issue by driving traffic. It shifts the focus from general management to targeted, specialized problem-solving.

2.  "हमें पता है वो सिर्फ बिजनेस ग्रोथ करनी है आपको। तो आप निश्चिंत होकर काम कर सकते हो हमारे साथ।"
    *   Where to use in Bad Call: Early in the call after understanding the customer wants to restart, and especially when discussing the purpose of their services or the cost.
    *   Expected Impact: This phrase immediately aligns the agent with the customer's ultimate goal, indicating a focus beyond mere service provision to actual business outcomes. It would build confidence and trust by showing the agent understands the customer's core motivation, making the subsequent service descriptions more relevant and compelling.

3.  "आपकी लिस्टिंग से लेकर आपकी सेल्स को बूस्ट करने तक हम आपको सपोर्ट करते हैं।" (Good Call used a similar version implicitly, but the Bad Call agent used this phrase, so I'll adapt it.)
    *   Winning Phrase from Good Call: "हम पूरी प्रोफाइल पर हम ही लोग टेक केयर करेंगे। आपका काम सिर्फ आपका अपनी प्रोफाइल को आप सिर्फ ओवरलुक करोगे।" (0:47-0:52)
    *   Where to use in Bad Call: When outlining the scope of services, particularly after the customer mentions starting with 5-6 SKUs and wanting to grow.
    *   Expected Impact: This clearly defines the division of labor and promises comprehensive support, reducing the customer's perceived burden. In the Bad Call, where the customer is looking to restart and grow, this would instill confidence that all aspects of his Meesho account, from setup to sales, will be handled by experts, allowing him to focus on manufacturing. It's a clear statement of problem ownership and value.

--- MISSING ELEMENTS IN BAD CALL ---
1.  **Clear distinction between basic listing and brand store/A+ content:** The agent struggles to explain the value proposition of a brand store or enhanced content, despite the customer's established brand and desire for proper representation.
2.  **A structured process to resolve trademark/brand registry issues:** The agent gets stuck when the customer mentions having a trademark but lacks formal registration proof, failing to offer clear steps or alternatives to address Amazon's requirements.
3.  **Proactive strategies for improving visibility and sales:** While the customer expresses a desire to increase sales, the agent's proposed solution remains focused on basic listing without elaborating on how to achieve better search rankings or attract more customers effectively.
4.  **Empathy and validation of the customer's long-standing business experience:** The agent frequently overlooks or dismisses the customer's 40 years of business experience, leading to a breakdown in rapport and making the customer feel unheard.
5.  **A definite call to action or clear next steps:** The call ends without a firm agreement on how to proceed, leaving the customer responsible for gathering more information (trademark documents) without a clear follow-up plan from the agent.

--- WINNING PHRASES MAPPING ---
1.  "पहले हम ऐसा करते हैं, पहले हम 10 आइटम डाल के उसको देखेंगे भी ये कैसे दिख रही हैं, ये सब कुछ हमारे हिसाब से जो हम चाह रहे हैं वैसे ही हो रहा है" (6:03)
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** When the customer expresses hesitation about committing to a large number of products or questions the effectiveness of the service. (e.g., at 5:53, when the customer says they don't want to just keep putting in products if the strategy is wrong)
    *   **Expected Impact:** This offers a low-risk, measurable pilot program, building confidence by allowing the customer to see tangible results and validate the approach before making a larger commitment. It aligns with the customer's need for a "demo or trial."

2.  "हम इंडिया के एक नंबर वन सर्विस प्रोवाइडिंग कंपनी हैं... हमारा जो काम होगा वो 10th ऑफ़ फेब से स्टार्ट होगा" (6:53)
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** Early in the conversation (e.g., at 0:17 or 0:25) when discussing their company's capabilities and commitment to quality.
    *   **Expected Impact:** This immediately establishes credibility and sets a professional standard, reassuring the customer about the agent's expertise and the company's ability to deliver, potentially mitigating the customer's frustrations and building trust.

3.  "अभी हमारी ब्रांड रजिस्ट्री करनी है पहले, ठीक है? ट्रेडमार्क के थ्रू ब्रांड रजिस्ट्री करनी है। उसके बाद हमारे को अपने कैटेगरी अप्रूवल लेके और मैं लिस्टिंग स्टार्ट करनी है उससे।" (6:33)
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** When the conversation gets stuck on the trademark issue (e.g., at 4:40 or 1:35:00) or when the customer is confused about the overall process.
    *   **Expected Impact:** This provides a clear, structured roadmap to the customer, demystifying the Amazon onboarding process and directly addressing the core brand registration hurdle with a sequential plan. It would help the customer understand the exact steps required and regain confidence in the agent's guidance.

[00:02] Customer: Hello.
[00:03] Customer: Hello.
[00:05] Customer: Rajendra Singh bol raha hu, ye aapka go.com pe net pe search kiya tha maine. Product upload karne ke liye.
[00:13] Agent: Hmm.
[00:15] Customer: Toh aap kahan par based hain, Delhi mein sir?
[00:17] Agent: Gurgaon based hain.
[00:20] Agent: Gurgaon based hain.
[00:21] Customer: Achcha, lekin ye hai ki hamare item jo hain, woh is tarah ki hain ki B2B business hai hamara.
[00:27] Agent: Theek hai.
[00:28] Customer: Woh bahut limited item hain. Toh online sale zyada nahi honi hai, lekin hum khali presentation matlab ho jaye hamari presentation market ho jati hai, na isse. Hum product dal lete hain.
[00:37] Agent: Samajh gaya, samajh gaya. Nahi main samajh gaya, aapki visibility main samajh gaya. Aapka naam jaan sakta hu, sir main?
[00:42] Customer: Rajendra Singh.
[00:44] Agent: Rajendra ji. Aisa hai ki aapki baat theek hai, visibility aapko mil sakti hai. Par main cheez ye hai ki abhi hum agar chahe toh us par optimization us level pe aayenge, na. Toh usmein aapko response bhi mil sakta hai.
[00:56] Customer: Woh main samajh gaya aapki baat, usmein to kharcha hota hai na saal ka alag se.
[01:01] Agent: Kis cheez ke upar?
[01:03] Customer: Online optimization bol rahe ho aap, uski baat kar rahe ho na?
[01:05] Agent: Bilkul. Aisa hota hai, aapko batata hu. Main jo kaam hota hai hamara sara ranking ke upar hota hai. Basically agar product rank karega hamara, toh definitely humein wahan se numbers milte hain ache.
[01:14] Agent: Ji. Abhi baat karte hain, aapne kaha sir, sirf listing karani hai aapko?
[01:19] Customer: Meri baat suno, main aapko one to one baat karta hu pehle. Ek pehle point solve kar le, fir agli baat karenge. Hamare paas hamari item ki range hai, kareeb 12000 item hai.
[01:29] Agent: Theek hai.
[01:30] Customer: Theek hai. Kitni hai 12000. Usmein teen char hazaar item jo hain, woh aisi hain jo bikti hain. Matlab once in a while bikti hain. Aur 500-700 item aisi hoti hain jo regular bikti hain.
[01:35] Agent: Theek hai.
[01:41] Agent: Theek hai.
[01:42] Customer: Lekin range humko poori dikhani isliye padti hai, poori range se hi kaam chalta hai, kyunki range hone se customer ko ek believe rehta hai ki haan, ye.
[01:50] Agent: Samajh gaya.
[01:50] Customer: Iske paas variety hai ya saara product banati hai, ye cheez hai. Hum log ka 40 saal purana business hai, lekin abhi kya hai hamare paas kaam, business, sales bahut kam ho gayi hain. Kyunki ek toh gaadiyon mein road theek ho gaye ya caron mein sales kam hai. Toh hum usko sale ko increase karna chahte hain, toh hum chahte hain ki presentation ho jaye Amazon pe. Uske baad Amazon ke paas agar show hoga ki har customer ko ek price ka woh mil jayega indication, jaise suppose ek item 500 rupaye ki hum bechte hain. Dealer ko 250 bhi dete hain hum log discount 50% rehta hai hamara. Toh woh item ko jab woh kharidega dealer se, toh Amazon pe jab check karega, toh 500 Amazon pe aayega, toh woh dealer se lete hue hichkega nahi.
[02:28] Customer: Samajh rahe ho?
[02:29] Agent: Samajh gaya.
[02:29] Customer: Ye hai mera. Aur maksad hamara jo aap keh rahe ho optimization karna ya ranking number pe ek pe dalna ya jaise koi search karega, sabse pehle hamara dikhega.
[02:38] Agent: Bilkul.
[02:38] Customer: Uske filhaal hamein zaroorat nahi hai, uski zaroorat padegi.
[02:40] Agent: Theek hai.
[02:40] Customer: Jab padegi toh woh services bhi le lenge. Filhaal jo humein zaroorat hai, woh ye hai.
[02:43] Agent: Theek hai.
[02:44] Customer: Ki humko sari item ko photograph aur detail ke saath acche se, sundar tarike se Amazon seller account pe dalna hai.
[02:52] Agent: Theek hai. Do cheeze poochta hu aapse. Definitely GST apne paas hoga. Toh apne ko ismein as a brand aapne visibility ki baat kari thi abhi ki main aap product visible ho, ki usko dikh jaaye ki agar koi bhi kharid raha hai, toh use ek online meri presence dikh jaye. Toh abhi listing humein karani hai.
[03:06] Customer: Brand hamara already popular hai. Brand mein koi problem nahi hai.
[03:10] Agent: Hmm.
[03:11] Customer: Baat sirf ye hai ki itemon ko humne online dalna hai Amazon pe.
[03:15] Agent: Theek hai.
[03:15] Customer: Jaise koi meri ek item, maan lo meri item number hai 1505. Theek hai?
[03:19] Agent: Hmm. Hmm.
[03:20] Customer: Mere jo customers hain woh unko pata hai 1505 number item hai. Ab koi customer jab dukan se leta hai 1505 number item, toh woh jab Amazon mein dalega ki 1505, exact toh usko samne woh item dikh jayegi.
[03:31] Agent: Theek hai.
[03:32] Agent: Theek hai.
[03:32] Customer: Toh usko uska rate bhi dikh jayega, uski sab kuch dikh jayega usko.
[03:35] Agent: Theek hai.
[03:36] Customer: Ho jayega sir. Main itna kaam hai bas filhaal.
[03:36] Agent: Okay.
[03:39] Agent: Theek hai. Ab ek ab thoda mere samajhna. Aapki baat theek hai bilkul. Ab Amazon mein sir listing do tareeke ki hoti hai. Thoda bata deta hu. Ek basic listings hoti hain, ek A+ listing hoti hai. Theek hai. Apna mere khayal se jo aap soch rahe ho, woh basic listing hi soch rahe ho abhi.
[03:54] Agent: Hai na?
[03:55] Customer: Achcha. Woh basic listing kya hota hai?
[03:56] Agent: Basic listing mein infographics aur banners nahi hote hain.
[04:01] Agent: Aapko toh sirf presentation apni karni hai. Aur doosri cheez, trademark hota hai na jispe unhi ki ho pati hai. A+ listing, aap brand store dekha hoga aapne ek. Store front hota hai usmein poora aapka brand ka naam, kitne items hain. Aapne store front dekha hoga na bade bade brands ka? Jaise aap kisi ko bhi aake abhi aap agar aapke saamne system hai, toh koi bhi agar brand search karo, Manna, Ghaji, is tareeke se hamare brands hain. Toh is tareeke ke agar aap Reebok search karte ho, maan lo. Toh Reebok agar aap search karoge, toh unka store front aayega listing ke upar likha hua. Visit the Reebok store is tareeke se. Toh poore store front aate hain. Toh usmein infographics aur banners hote hain.
[04:33] Agent: Theek hai. Toh woh tabhi hota hai jab hamare paas trademark hota hai. Toh abhi aapne kaha mera bahut 40 saal purana business hai. Trademark hai apne paas?
[04:40] Customer: Haan, trademark hai na.
[04:42] Agent: Toh aap brand store ki taraf jana chahoge ya sirf aap sirf listings hi karwaoge?
[04:47] Customer: Brand store jo brand ke upar hi jayenge, brand store mein jayenge. Brand toh dikhna hi chahiye, brand ke baad hi aage ki baat hoti hai.
[04:52] Agent: Main bata raha hu. Sir ek hota hai listing karadi humne, theek hai. Maine aapka naam search kara. Toh mujhe aapka naam dikh raha hai, brand bhi dikh raha hai. Aapne jo aapne item bech rahe ho, woh bhi dikh raha hai. Ek hota hai brand store.
[05:03] Customer: Brand store kya bolte ho?
[05:04] Agent: Haan, brand store, jaise ek tareeke se aap ek kaam karta hu, main aapko ya toh kisi ka link, aap matlab normally Amazon pe search karoge na koi bhi bada brand, toh ek listing ke upar likha hua aayega visit their store. Jaise Red Tape agar aap search karoge shoes mein, toh aapko aayega visit the Red Tape store. Listing ke neeche hi likha hua halka sa, jahan title aata hai na likha hua, uske neeche. Toh poora store khul ke aa jata hai poora unka. Toh bade brands ko jo presence jisko create karani hoti hai, woh is tareeke se apna brand store banwate hain yahan se.
[05:30] Customer: Achcha.
[05:32] Agent: Bilkul. Theek hai. Toh abhi toh main saari cheeze samajh chuka hu. Abhi mujhe batao, kitne products honge apne paas total?
[05:37] Customer: Nahi, hum pehle usko start karenge. Pehle usko jaise hum log, main aapko 50 product dunga, daliye. Pehle usko dekhte hain kya hota hai, kya result aata hai. Result matlab ye nahi hai, customer kya result dete hain. Humein kaise presence milti hai uski.
[05:47] Agent: Theek hai. Theek hai.
[05:48] Customer: Toh humein jab lagega sab okay hai, toh fir hum jo sare product dalenge hum, uske bare mein baat kar lenge.
[05:53] Agent: Theek hai.
[05:53] Customer: Main aapko bol du, dal do 5000 item meri. Fir uske baad 5000 aap dalte raho, dalte raho, dalte raho. Aur hamara jo woh hai, woh formula hi galat ho jaye.
[06:01] Agent: Theek hai.
[06:02] Customer: Hai na? Pehle abhi aisa karte hain, pehle humein 10 item dal ke usko dekhenge ki ye kaise dikh rahi hain, ye sab kuch hamare hisab se jo hum cha rahe hain, vaise hi ho raha hai. Search karta hai, toh yahi aise hi aa raha hai. Toh jo humein sab kuch satisfaction ho jayegi humein, toh fir hum uske baad usko jo jis level pe jana hai, saari bhi item dal sakte hain.
[06:03] Agent: Theek hai.
[06:18] Agent: Theek hai, samajh gaya aapki baat. Toh abhi apne accounts Amazon pe open hain ya nahi hain?
[06:23] Customer: Amazon account maine aaj hi reseller registration maine pehle kara rakha tha, lekin aaj maine usko kaam aaj shuru kiya hai maine.
[06:29] Agent: Theek hai. Toh abhi hamari, main abhi dekho, abhi main aapko thoda bata hu. Abhi brand registry karni hai pehle. Theek hai. Trademark ke through humein brand registry karni hai. Uske baad hamare ko apne category approval leke humein listing start karni hai. Toh aap hamare saath ye kar sakte ho, theek hai. Mera abhi 50 listings agar aap karwate ho, toh 2000 plus GST mein hum aise kar sakte ho.
[06:49] Agent: Theek hai. Par hamare saath ek challenge ye hai ki aapne jaise hamari presence dekhi hogi, ki hum India ke ek number one service providing company hain. Theek hai. Toh hamara jo kaam hoga, woh 10th of Feb se start hoga. Reason ye hai, uska, kyunki hum koi bhi normal listings ya basic listings us level ki nahi karte hain. Theek hai. Hamari jitni bhi cheeze hain, uske liye sara Amazon se insights aata hai, sara data aata hai. Toh uske liye kya hai ki abhi unka internal kuch technical issues hain. Ye aapko koi bhi aur company nahi batayegi ye baat. Theek hai. Ki ab ye kuch internal issues hain ki aapka kaam us level pe abhi aapko response nahi aayega Amazon se. Theek hai. Kyunki due to sales, aur due to heavy traffic, theek hai. Abhi Amazon ki jo new onboarding hain, wahan pe thoda sa challenges aa rahe hain traffic ke regarding. Theek hai. Toh isiliye tab tak hum log listing preparation aur baki saari cheeze karte hain. Theek hai. Aur 2000 rupaye ki aapki 50 listings aapki ho jayengi. Theek hai. Aur 4000 plus GST mein aapka brand registry ho jayegi.
[07:39] Agent: Ji.
[07:40] Customer: Brand registry kya hota hai matlab?
[07:41] Agent: Brand registry hota hai, main batata hu. Jaise aapka ek brand name hai. Theek hai. Uske through koi aur brand toh nahi bech raha hai. Aapne kaha mere paas trademark hai. Hai na? Toh main uske through apne brand ki registry karunga, ki jo bhi main product bech raha hu, woh saare mere brand ke hain.
[07:56] Customer: Haan, haan. Bilkul.
[07:58] Agent: Ye hota hai.
[07:58] Customer: Achcha, uski registry karni padti hai?
[08:00] Agent: Brand registry hoti hai simple. Jaise main batata hu. Pehle Amazon pe accounts kholte hain, fir brand registry hoti hai. Fir category approval hota hai aur fir listings hoti hain.
[08:08] Customer: Achcha.
[08:09] Agent: Abhi aapka process sirf listing tak ka hai. Fir listing ke baad listing optimizations hote hain. Fir hum log usmein keyword update karte hain ki apni ranking ke liye, toh woh hum log ko bhi jaana nahi hai us part pe. Abhi toh humein sirf listing tak jaana hai.
[08:20] Agent: Bilkul.
[08:22] Customer: Agar pehle brand register kar rahe hain, pehle sellers account bana liya humne, theek hai?
[08:25] Agent: Theek hai. Dekho, ab aapko batata hu. Aapne mail ID, phone number ke through apna seller account banaya hoga. Theek hai. Usmein aapne GST apna input kara hoga wahan pe. Theek hai. Jo relevant documents hote hain, jaise aapka PAN card, aapka address proof, cancel cheque, woh saari cheeze aapne input kari hongi. Theek hai. Uske baad kya hoga, abhi aapko usmein brand register karna padega apna. Kyunki do tareeke se chalta hai Amazon, main aapko batata hu. Balki teen tareeke hote hain. Ek toh generic hota hai. Generic matlab ki koi brand name nahi hai wahan pe. Theek hai. Aur humne ek kisi product ko list kar rakha wahan pe. Toh pata hi nahi chalta hai kaunse brand ka hai. Doosri cheez kya hoti hai, ki hum GTIN approvals ka option hota hai, jaise aap pe trademark nahi hai. Theek hai. Par aapko ek brand kholna hai Amazon pe. Toh aap uski brand registry karoge approvals leke aur uske baad aap trademark apply kar doge government ki side se. Theek hai. Trademark aane mein time lagta hai. Teesra hota hai trademark jis pe hai, woh trademark ke through apna register kar leta hai. Ye hota hai process.
[09:15] Customer: Trademark hota hai, woh kar leta hai.
[09:17] Agent: Aap pe jaise aapne bataya na, registered trademark apne paas hai, toh hum usi naam se toh karenge, kyunki hamara company name hai. Uske naam se wahan pe store front khulega uski. Bilkul.
[09:26] Agent: Hmm.
[09:27] Customer: Jisne hamare se proprietary mark hai hamare paas toh shuru se 40 saal se.
[09:30] Agent: Kya hai bhi aap pe?
[09:32] Customer: Vijecs ke naam se, V.I.J.G.E.X.
[09:34] Agent: V.I.J.G.E.X. Samajh gaya main.
[09:36] Customer: V.I.J.G.E.X. ka hai, toh logo bhi hai uska aur woh bhi.
[09:40] Agent: Toh usi logo ko dekho main batata hu, hum haan, toh apna jo trademark jo hai na, usko hum as a label har brand pe usko hum input karenge. Aur jab bhi kuch bhi jo bhi hum store front bhi create karenge, toh aapka jo brand logo hoga, uski wahan visibility aayegi.
[09:54] Agent: Bilkul.
[09:56] Customer: Agar Amazon mein pehle humein brand register karana padta hai, aap ye keh rahe ho. Brand registry karni padti hai.
[10:01] Agent: Brand registry aap kara loge. Uske baad apne ko category approval lena hota hai. Theek hai. Uske baad hum kaam karenge. Haan, category approval hota hai ki product wise pehle listing har cheez ki hoti hai, uske baad uska category approval hota hai. Toh uske liye main aapko thoda example deta hu. Jaise hamare dry fruits hote hain, na, toh uske liye alag alag documents hote hain, jaise lab test reports hain, FSSAI ka license hai. Theek hai. Is tareeke se har category ke alag alag hote hain. Toh woh humein lene hote hain category approvals un required documents ke through.
[10:27] Agent: Bilkul.
[10:28] Customer: Lekin hamare jo item hai, usmein toh koi category, no floor ka hi hai nahi.
[10:32] Agent: Nahi sab.
[10:32] Customer: Woh toh motor part banate hain, motor part mein koi category.
[10:34] Agent: Aapke spare parts hain.
[10:36] Customer: Haan.
[10:36] Agent: Isko hum spare parts category kehte hain. Ismein extra koi extra documents nahi hote. Theek hai. Par category approval ke liye declaration file karni padti hai.
[10:45] Customer: Declaration kya matlab? Kya kehna chahte ho?
[10:47] Agent: Ek declaration form hota hai simple ki like we are selling this aur jo hum trademark ke through register kar lenge, toh woh cheez hamara key account manager kar deta hai saari cheeze. Woh aapko kuch bhi nahi karna usmein sir. Aapko sirf apne input dene hain humein listing ke liye. Aapko listing ke liye basic uski images deni hain, theek hai, product ke apne aur basic manufacturers details. Baaki uske titles, keywords, bullet pointers, jo bhi saari cheeze hain, woh hamara key account manager karta hai.
[11:10] Agent: Bilkul.
[11:11] Customer: Woh main samajh gaya aapki baat, samajh gaya. Lekin humein pehle is cheez ko iska demo ya trial toh karna padega na pehle ki kaise kya hota hai.
[11:18] Customer: Brand se aap keh rahe ho karane ke liye. Brand ke andar kya hamara logo register karenge woh ya hamara brand name.
[11:23] Agent: Bilkul. Brand name.
[11:25] Customer: Logo.
[11:26] Customer: Logo bhi kar denge, logo nahi karte.
[11:27] Agent: Haan, brand name and logo dono chahiye sir. Dekho trademark apna jo application letter aata hai.
[11:34] Customer: Hmm.
[11:35] Agent: Usmein ek hamara brand ka naam aur logo hota hai wahan pe?
[11:39] Customer: Haan.
[11:39] Agent: Toh usi usi trademark.
[11:42] Customer: Brand humne register nahi karwa rakha hai, lekin hamara already 40 saal se registered hai. Kisi ki himmat nahi hai na kuch kar le. Proprietary ownership hoti hai na proprietary ownership. Samajhte ho aap kya hota hai trademark mein?
[11:51] Agent: Nahi nahi.
[11:52] Customer: Apne trademark.
[11:54] Agent: Main samajh gaya aapki baat.
[11:56] Agent: Lekin trademark registered nahi hai apna.
[11:59] Customer: Registered toh tha pehle. Pehle isse pehle hamari company usmein registered thi. Ab private limited company ban gayi hai na, toh wahi chala rahe hain hum toh. Humne registration wali baat ki thi trademark wale se. Woh keh raha hai aapko zaroorat nahi hai kuch bhi karne ki. Aapko toh shuru se chal raha hai.
[12:13] Agent: Ji sir thoda sa.
[12:14] Agent: Main nahi, main aapki baat samajh raha hu. Par ye dekho aap mere aur aapke kehne se woh baat aapki theek hai. Par Amazon jo accept karta hai, toh woh saari cheeze hain, na. Fir humein ye usse brand approval lena padega warna fir GTIN ke through, fir naya trademark ya fir generic mein karna padega.
[12:30] Agent: Dekho aap ek baat samajhna. Ek meri baat suno sir. Aapko abhi register karna hai Amazon ke upar. Amazon jo document mangega, uske through hi toh kar paunga main.
[12:39] Customer: Achcha, kya mangte hai document woh?
[12:40] Agent: Nahi, trademark apna. Trademark ka jo application letter hota hai, woh.
[12:45] Customer: Woh mangta hai?
[12:46] Agent: Haan.
[12:48] Customer: Achcha.
[12:49] Agent: Jab woh ho jayega, toh nahi toh aap doosre brand se karoge fir usse. Jab apne paas aap keh rahe ho, mere paas trademark hai, mere paas hai mera brand registered. Hamara registered brand hai, toh trademark ke through hi toh brand hota hai register hamara.
[13:00] Customer: Achcha.
[13:03] Customer: Ji, toh trademark registration number nahi hai toh usko trademark nahi manenge, woh keh rahe ho aap?
[13:07] Agent: Sir aap aur kaise maan sakte hain aap? Batao.
[13:12] Agent: Ek second line pe raho, main ek cheez aur ye confirm kar leta hu aapke saamne.
[13:15] Agent: Theek hai.
[13:40] Agent: Hello.
[13:41] Customer: Haan ji, bolo.
[13:42] Agent: Haan wahi hai, nahi hoga sir. Usmein us brand ko register nahi hoga.
[13:47] Agent: Bilkul.
[13:48] Customer: Kis brand se?
[13:49] Agent: Jo aapka, aap bata na, Vijecs jo aapka hai, uska trademark aap pe nahi. Toh trademark nahi hai toh us naam se kaise register ho jayega aapka?
[13:58] Customer: Trademark nahi hai, trademark nahi kaise matlab? Trademark nahi kaise manta hai woh?
[14:02] Agent: Are trademark ke liye trademark ka application letter hota hai, na. Aapne trademark TM, R hoga. Aapke brand pe print hoga woh cheez. Aapko uska registration hoga, certification, trademark certification. Woh agar aap pe hai toh ho jayega. Ab nahi hai toh fir kaise ho sakta hai fir woh?
[14:16] Customer: Achcha achcha. Chalo main fir pehle wala hai, ye hamara isko dekhta hu main, fir batata hu aapko.
[14:20] Agent: Ek baar dekho aur main bilkul bilkul. Bilkul. Mera naam Akash hai, aap mujhe connect kar sakte ho bilkul.
[14:25] Customer: Theek hai, okay.
[14:26] Agent: Ji.

--- MISSING ELEMENTS IN BAD CALL ---
1.  **Preparedness and Pre-call Research**: The agent clearly did not review the customer's previous interaction or proposal before the call, leading to confusion and an inability to address the core issue.
2.  **Active Listening and Recall**: The agent failed to actively listen or recall crucial details from the prior conversation, forcing the customer to prompt and clarify.
3.  **Effective Objection Handling**: The agent had no strategy or immediate response to the customer's "heavy charges" objection, resulting in immediate failure to progress.
4.  **Solution-Oriented Approach**: There was no attempt to offer alternative solutions, break down pricing, or explain value to mitigate the cost concern.
5.  **Professional Demeanor and Confidence**: The agent's hesitant tone and lack of knowledge conveyed a lack of professionalism and confidence, which negatively impacted trust.

--- WINNING PHRASES MAPPING ---
1.  "डेफिनेटली क्वालिटी ऑफ वर्क तो आपको मिलेगा ही इसमें" -> "When the customer brings up the 'heavy charges' and mentions their concern about getting value." -> "This phrase would instill confidence in the customer that, despite the cost, the quality of service will justify the investment, shifting the focus from price to value."
2.  "अगर जो आप ग्राफिक्स आप अपने प्रोवाइड करते हैं तो पर लिस्टिंग हमारा 500 होता है" -> "Immediately after the customer states that the 'charges bahut heavy hai sir' and before having to defer the call." -> "This phrase offers an immediate, flexible solution to address the pricing concern, demonstrating problem-solving and willingness to work with the customer's existing resources, potentially keeping the conversation alive and leading to a positive outcome without rescheduling."
3.  "मैं आपको मेरी टीम में से बेस्ट होगा जो...ही अपॉइंट कराऊंगी" -> "When the customer expresses general dissatisfaction or hesitation due to initial confusion or perceived high cost, implying a lack of trust." -> "This phrase would signal a strong commitment to customer success and a high level of service. It demonstrates that the company takes ownership of providing top-tier support, reassuring the customer about future interactions and rebuilding trust immediately."
