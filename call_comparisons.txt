--- MISSING ELEMENTS IN BAD CALL ---
1.  **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Usage / Call Preparation:** The agent in the bad call clearly did not access or review any prior customer interaction notes or CRM entries before or during the call, leading to significant confusion regarding names and past meetings.
2.  **Proactive Problem Identification and Resolution:** Instead of getting stuck in a loop of identity clarification, the agent should have quickly identified the core problem (misidentification) and offered a swift resolution, such as transferring to a colleague or checking internal records more thoroughly.
3.  **Active Listening and Confirmation:** The agent consistently failed to listen effectively and confirm details, instead repeatedly correcting the customer's perception of names and past conversations, escalating frustration.
4.  **Empathy and Professional Tone:** The agent lacked empathy, appearing defensive and prioritizing correcting the customer's memory over understanding their actual query and maintaining a helpful, professional demeanor.
5.  **Clear Next Steps and Accountability:** The bad call ended without a concrete plan or a clear timeline for how the customer's initial query would eventually be addressed, lacking accountability for follow-up.

--- WINNING PHRASES MAPPING ---
1.  "what the best we can do, we can just schedule a Google Meet so that we can have a proper discussion about everything like your queries I will be like answering and we can have your planning as well." (2:39-2:48)
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** After the initial confusion about names (e.g., around 1:20 or 2:00), once some basic information is confirmed. The agent could say, "I apologize for the confusion regarding the names. To ensure we properly address your needs, what I can do is schedule a Google Meet with the correct team member so we can have a proper discussion about everything, and I will make sure all your queries are answered and we can plan effectively."
    *   **Expected Impact:** This phrase would immediately shift the focus from past confusion and blame to a clear, actionable, and future-oriented solution. It demonstrates proactivity, offers a structured discussion, and implies expert handling, thereby rebuilding trust and injecting momentum into the stalled conversation.

2.  "you are products should be available on those particular pincodes. Okay? And as a company we are not providing any services on Blinkit and. Because we can't provide any actual services there." (1:17-1:26)
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** While this specific context (selling on platforms) wasn't reached, if the conversation had progressed to specific service limitations. For example, if the customer requested a service the company doesn't offer.
    *   **Expected Impact:** This phrase provides a clear, logical, and transparent reason for why a particular service or platform cannot be supported, without being dismissive. It sets realistic expectations and prevents further misunderstanding by offering a justifiable explanation, which is crucial for maintaining trust even when delivering a "no."

3.  "But we're working on marketplaces because they help you to like build a brand and provide you end to end everything." (1:35-1:41)
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** Similar to the previous phrase, if a service limitation was identified, this phrase would follow the explanation of "why not." For instance, "While we might not directly support X, we focus on marketplaces like Y and Z because they help you to build a brand and provide you end-to-end everything."
    *   **Expected Impact:** This phrase immediately pivots from a "no" to a positive "yes, and here's how we can help even better," framing alternatives as superior solutions. It focuses on tangible customer benefits (brand building, comprehensive support), demonstrating the agent's problem-solving attitude and re-engaging the customer positively, even if their initial request isn't directly met.

--- MISSING ELEMENTS IN BAD CALL ---
1.  **Initial Verification and Confirmation:** The agent in the bad call immediately states query details without first asking the customer to confirm their identity or if they recall making any recent inquiries.
2.  **Apology for Potential System Error/Confusion:** Upon the customer's repeated denial, the agent does not apologize for the confusion or the possibility of a system error.
3.  **Offer to Investigate Data Discrepancy:** The agent never offers to investigate why their system shows a query from the customer if the customer explicitly denies it.
4.  **Empathy and Acknowledgment of Customer's Perspective:** There is no attempt to acknowledge the customer's confusion or frustration when they deny having raised the query.
5.  **Proactive Problem-Solving/Alternative Assistance:** The call ends without any proposed solution to rectify the incorrect query or to offer assistance if the customer *did* have a different query.

--- WINNING PHRASES MAPPING ---
1.  "अच्छा, नहीं मुझे लगा आप वो आपने नंबर नहीं दिया, टू टिक नहीं आई तो मैंने सोचा शायद..." (0:06-0:10)
    -> **Where to use in Bad Call:** When the customer first denies making the query (e.g., after 0:17).
    -> **Expected Impact:** This phrase would allow the agent to acknowledge the customer's denial while explaining their own system's perspective. It signals active listening and a willingness to understand the discrepancy, rather than just insisting, making the customer feel heard and potentially preventing frustration.

2.  "हम आइडियली कॉलिंग से कनेक्ट नहीं करते हैं, मैं आपको... मैं आपको मैसेज भेजा था..." (0:26-0:31)
    -> **Where to use in Bad Call:** After the customer denies the query multiple times (e.g., after 0:26).
    -> **Expected Impact:** The agent could pivot from the incorrect query to a preferred or standard communication method. This shifts the focus from the disputed query to how they usually interact with customers, creating an opening for general assistance or to re-verify contact methods, rather than just repeating query details.

3.  "ऐसा हुआ तो हम Google Meet के थ्रू कनेक्ट हो जाएंगे जिससे कि वो भी कनेक्ट हो सकें Google Meet के लिंक पर और हम भी कनेक्ट हो सकें सो दैट कि हम फेस टू फेस बैठ के बात भी कर पाएं।" (2:02-2:10)
    -> **Where to use in Bad Call:** At the end of the call, when the customer is clearly confused and denying the query (e.g., after 0:56).
    -> **Expected Impact:** Instead of ending on a note of confusion, this phrase offers a clear, proactive, and collaborative solution. It could turn a negative interaction into a problem-solving opportunity, even if the initial query was invalid, by showing a commitment to help or clarify further, building potential trust.

--- MISSING ELEMENTS IN BAD CALL ---
1.  **Acknowledging Current State:** The agent fails to acknowledge and validate the customer's statement that they are currently managing their Amazon account themselves.
2.  **Probing for Future Needs/Pain Points:** Instead of pushing the service directly, the agent misses the opportunity to probe for potential future challenges or growth areas where their service could eventually be beneficial.
3.  **Open-Ended Discovery Questions:** The agent primarily asks yes/no or confirmation questions, rather than open-ended questions that could uncover underlying needs or motivations.
4.  **Active Listening to Disinterest:** The agent does not actively listen to or respond to the customer's explicit statements of disinterest (e.g., "abhi requirement to nahi hai manager ki").
5.  **Establishing Value Proposition Early:** The agent attempts to sell the service without first establishing a clear value proposition tailored to the customer's current situation or potential future needs.

--- WINNING PHRASES MAPPING ---
1.  "तो आप मुझे जो WhatsApp पर कांटेक्ट करती हैं, ये वो कौन सा नंबर है?" (0:17)
    -> **Where to use in Bad Call:** After the customer clarifies they are managing their Amazon account themselves (around 0:39-0:41 or 0:52-0:53).
    -> **Expected Impact:** This demonstrates active listening and a genuine attempt to understand the customer's current setup. It shifts from a sales pitch to a more consultative approach, potentially uncovering specific aspects of their current management that could be improved or areas where they might need help.

2.  "और फिर एक कॉन्फ्रेंस कॉल कर लेंगे।" (1:58)
    -> **Where to use in Bad Call:** After the customer states they are managing things themselves and mentions their daily order volume (around 1:09).
    -> **Expected Impact:** This shows proactive problem-solving. Instead of pushing for a manager, the agent could suggest a quick, low-commitment conference call to simply *share insights* on how others manage similar order volumes or discuss general best practices, thereby building trust without directly selling.

3.  "ऐसा हुआ तो हम Google Meet के थ्रू कनेक्ट हो जाएंगे, जिससे कि वो भी गाइड तो सकें Google Meet के लिंक पर और हम भी कनेक्ट हो सकें सो दैट कि हम face-to-face बैठकर बात भी कर पाएं।" (2:02)
    -> **Where to use in Bad Call:** When suggesting the conference call (as per the previous point) or if the customer expresses any hesitation about a direct call.
    -> **Expected Impact:** This phrase offers flexibility and a more personal, collaborative approach. It frames the interaction as a shared learning or problem-solving session rather than a hard sell, potentially making the customer more amenable to engaging and sharing more information. The "face-to-face" aspect (even virtual) helps build rapport and trust.

--- MISSING ELEMENTS IN BAD CALL ---
1.  **Preparation/Contextual Knowledge:** The agent in the bad call clearly lacked any prior knowledge or a quick review of the customer's previous interactions (e.g., onboarding with "Anshul/Adarsh").
2.  **Effective Identity Verification:** The agent failed to correctly identify the customer or their company's previous engagement, leading to a prolonged and unproductive discussion about names.
3.  **Customer Need Elicitation:** The call never progressed to understanding *why* the customer was calling beyond the initial confusion, completely missing the opportunity to discover their actual business needs.
4.  **Solution Provision:** Since the customer's problem was never properly identified, no relevant solutions or value could be offered during the call.
5.  **Clear Next Steps & Ownership:** The call ended vaguely with the agent stating he would connect the customer to someone else, without a concrete plan or taking ownership of the follow-up.

--- WINNING PHRASES MAPPING ---
1.  "what the best we can do is just schedule a Google Meet so that we can have a proper discussion about everything like your queries I will be like answering and we can have your planning as well."
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** At the point where the agent is confused about the previous meeting or client identity.
    *   **Expected Impact:** This would immediately pivot the conversation from confusion to a structured, solution-oriented approach, demonstrating professionalism and a clear path forward, even if initial context is missing. It implies taking ownership and a willingness to resolve the issue systematically.

2.  "Because we can't provide any actual services not there. Because the client has not acknowledged for like actual inventory. So therefore it is not possible to help on BlinqIt and Vep. But we are working on marketplaces because they help you to like build a brand and provide you end to end everything."
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** If the customer had mentioned a specific platform they wanted to use (like BlinqIt in the good call) and the agent needed to explain why it might not be suitable *from their side*.
    *   **Expected Impact:** This demonstrates transparency and expertise. It explains *why* something isn't possible, rather than just saying "no," and then immediately pivots to a viable alternative, showing a solution-oriented mindset.

3.  "Yeah, Amazon, Flipkart, JioMart, or Myntra, any market place, we can provide you."
    *   **Where to use in Bad Call:** After identifying the customer's core business need (e.g., selling products online).
    *   **Expected Impact:** This immediately shows the breadth of the agent's company's capabilities and reassures the customer that they can assist with their primary objective, building confidence and moving the conversation towards concrete solutions.
