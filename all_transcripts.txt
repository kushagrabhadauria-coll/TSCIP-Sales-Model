Customer: Hello.
I am Akash Agarwal from Adharsath.
You are talking about the year. We are talking about the closing of 12 months.
I will tell you.
I told you 35. You mean 35?
I said the last round. Then I gave you 2 lakh whole discount on the closing of 12 months.
So right now we are like.
You are talking about something else.
No, I was just saying that this can be done. It is less than 50.
You are expecting, please tell me your answer.
So I will try to help you.
One thing.
It will be 18% GST. That is for.
Yes, for. You tell me that the services you are providing now.
Okay. What are the charges? Tell me.
For a month, 500 SKU. It is 500 SKU per month.
One by one. I am asking about everyone's points.
If you talk about the charges, then it will be a bit long.
No problem, you can note it down.
Okay.
So, for 3 months, it will be a service.
Sir, this is your 3 months.
Yes, 3 months, 3 platforms.
Okay, okay.
Yes.
Now, what are your tools? What tools do they work on?
That is wearable tool. Some are free, some are paid tools, some are.
You will send the order. When you send the order, the invoice will also come.
No.
Okay, you print it out and attach it.
You have to print it out, attach it and deliver it.
The delivery will come to you, Amazon will pick it up from you. Or you can keep it in your warehouse and then deliver it.
No, that is basically a one-time fee.
Then their monthly fee.
Sir, meter.
Yes.
How much will it cost me, tell me.
Sir, that will depend on how much stock you are keeping.
So, I will send 50. But the thing is that after keeping the stock, then the pick-up charges will also be there.
It is an option. If you want to deliver to Amazon from your end, you can pick up the product from our warehouse. Then the delivery will be done by Amazon. Amazon also has a pick-up option. So you or any other delivery partner can pick it up from our warehouse. This is Amazon's.
If your product is selling well, I would suggest that you go for FBA. You will get Amazon's support.
Rs 40 per.
It will be 36 Amazon charge. And there is a one-time fee of 25-30 rupees or something. It is between 25-30. It is a one-time fee.
So, you are talking about the charges.
Yes, definitely.
The customer will tell us what the issue is.
What is the issue?
It depends on the base. If the customer has an issue with the size or color, then the return is generally valid.
It is not like that.
It means there is an issue with the size.
Yes, or there is a manufacturing defect.
Okay.
But what if the customer cancels from our side? What will we do?
I will handle it and you will also make a video.
It will be like, you will get a form. So you will have to send it to us. Then we will generate a ticket.
The photos you are talking about.
That is your choice, sir. Whenever I list, I recommend.
If you make a video once. If there is a defect in the product that has come, then we will generate a ticket from our end and you will get 50% refund, which the platform gives.
60% if you see, my issue is that 60% means totally. The rating we will list will be that of.
So your list.
Whatever is listed, you will get a refund.
Okay.
Sir, what about the charges? As I told you, okay. It became 7.5%. And if I sell a product of 100 rupees, I will make it 120-125.
Definitely.
Okay, sir. So if I sell it for 220 plus, it will be 7.5%.
220 7.5%.
7.5% or 7%, what is Amazon's fee?
It is 60-70 rupees.
Sir, Pan India. I am asking a question. How can you decide 7 rupees because of the weight? If it is 500, 600, 700.
Okay. So you can say that the cheaper the shoe, the more expensive it becomes. The more expensive it is, the cheaper it becomes. If it is 500, 600, 700, then it will naturally be light in weight. Its weight will be less.
Definitely, definitely. I want to tell you, please tell me what your sales rate is. You calculate.
It will be deducted, final cost will be calculated.
Your picking charges are. Whatever we store, we will deduct it.
You are saying that if I sell something for 100-200, I also have to calculate everything. It means there are hidden charges. It means I am paying 100, 200 rupees and then I am getting returns and then I am paying extra charges. Then after 3 months, I am paying extra charges.
Definitely.
Sir, if I am taking your guidance, I can ask you because it is my platform. I am taking your guidance that what will be my cost, how should I keep it, what should I not keep, which return is better, then I have to add the entire cost to my budget. Because if I do not, I will not be able to do my costing. It is getting returns, my packing is getting wasted, my courier charges are also there. So I have to see the end of the total percentage that is coming. So after all this, what will be left in the end? So I have to calculate the price according to that and I have to see it within the budget.
Yes, absolutely. I am also saying that.
If you do not, then I am putting the ball in your court. So, 220 rupees. You tell me what cost I should apply.
I am telling you that for calculation, you have to choose a better product. So you will get a better product.
Give me a minute.
You are saying that I will send you the photos. You will bring the photos from your side.
Sir, I am Akash. What is your name?
Kiran, sir.
Okay. Can I know what you talked about earlier?
Sir, Akash ji, the company is offering me that I will take the service. I said okay.
I am listening.
